        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Mary's new favourite lunch – quick and easy to make and oh so tasty. If your ciabatta loaf is long and narrow, cut it on the diagonal to give a larger surface area to hold all the topping.</p>
        <p>For this recipe you need a mini food processor to make the tapenade.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>70g/2½oz pitted black olives, drained if from a jar</li>
            <li>3 tbsp sun-dried tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 tsp runny honey</li>
            <li>1½ tsp white wine vinegar</li>
            <li>2 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove, crushed</li>
            <li>6 thick slices ciabatta</li>
            <li>1 tbsp fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 just-ripe avocado, flesh sliced into strips</li>
            <li>2 ripe tomatoes, deseeded and sliced into strips</li>
            <li>1 small bunch basil, leaves only, some torn and some left whole to garnish</li>
            <li>200g/7oz buffalo mozzarella, torn into pieces</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>For the tapenade, measure all the tapenade ingredients into a mini food processor. Pulse until well chopped and the mixture forms a rough paste. Season with salt and pepper and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat a griddle pan or heavy-based frying pan until hot.</li>
            <li>Mix the oil and garlic together in a bowl. Brush the ciabatta slices with the garlic oil and then chargrill or pan-fry the bread for 2 minutes on each side until brown and crispy.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat and spread the tapenade over the toasts.</li>
            <li>Drizzle the lemon juice over the avocado, then arrange on the toasts, followed by the tomato strips, torn basil and mozzarella. Season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
            <li>Drizzle with extra oil before serving, and garnish with the whole basil leaves.</li>
        </ol>
